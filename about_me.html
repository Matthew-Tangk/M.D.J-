                <h2>Hi, I'm Matthew</h2>
                <p>I am a creative and passionate individual who is driven by my love for design, technology and art. As
                    a 2nd year student of multimedia and communication design at the Amsterdam University of Applied
                    Science,
                    I have developed a strong foundation in website design, coding and programming. I am always looking
                    to
                    improve my skills and push the boundaries of what is possible with technology and design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of my main sources of inspiration comes from Japanese artists such as Hokusai, Takashi Murakami
                    and
                    Masashi Kishimoto. Their unique styles and approach to art have had a profound impact on my own
                    work,
                    and I
                    strive to incorporate elements of their work into my own designs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing bass, reading and painting murals. Music and art have always been a
                    big
                    part of my life, and I find that they help to inspire and motivate me in my work as a designer.
                    Overall,
                    I
                    am a dedicated and motivated individual who is always looking to learn and grow as a designer and
                    developer.
                </p>
